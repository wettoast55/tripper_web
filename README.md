# Tripper: Group Travel Planning with AI

Tripper is a cross-platform group travel planning app built with Flutter, Firebase, and FastAPI. It helps groups collaboratively select trip destinations based on survey consensus, then uses AI and real-time flight deals to recommend optimized travel plans. Each user fills out a travel preferences survey, and Tripper intelligently recommends destinations that best match the group.

## üåê App Overview

### Purpose

To streamline group trip planning by combining:

* **Individual surveys** for travel preferences.
* **AI-generated destination recommendations** using GPT (via OpenRouter).
* **Live travel deals** from Amadeus APIs.
* **Group consensus detection** with dynamic filtering and survey conflict resolution.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend (Flutter)

* `flutter` (web and mobile)
* `cloud_firestore` for Firebase
* `shared_preferences` for user session
* `http` for backend API calls
* `intl` for formatting dates

### Backend (FastAPI)

* `fastapi` for building the API
* `httpx` for outbound API calls
* `firebase_admin` for Firestore admin access
* `apscheduler` for scheduled cleanups
* Integration with:

  * OpenRouter.ai (GPT-3.5)
  * Amadeus (live flight deals)

### Firebase

* Firestore database
* Collections:

  * `groups`
  * `surveys`
  * `users`

---

## ‚ö° Key Features

### Surveys

Each user fills out a survey that includes:

* Budget: Budget, Medium, High
* Travel Month
* Activities
* Travel Methods (car, plane, etc.)
* Accommodation Preferences
* Preferred Destinations/Regions
* Interests
* Travel Date Range (start + end)

### Group Trip Recommendation

* Users in the same group submit surveys.
* When ready, the group can tap the FAB (Floating Action Button) to fetch group AI recommendations.
* The AI endpoint filters for consensus and shared preferences.
* Outlier responses are highlighted visually if there's no consensus.

### Live Flight Deals

* Tapping on a destination suggestion shows the cheapest flights (origin currently static, to be dynamic later).

## üìä Data Model Overview

### Firestore Collections:

#### `users`

```json
{
  "userId": "abc123",
  "displayName": "Kevin",
  "email": "kevin@example.com"
}
```

#### `groups`

```json
{
  "groupId": "groupABC",
  "name": "Friends NYC Trip",
  "members": ["abc123", "def456"]
}
```

#### `surveys`

```json
{
  "userId": "abc123",
  "groupId": "groupABC",
  "budget": "Medium",
  "month": "June",
  "activities": ["hiking", "nightlife"],
  "travelMethods": ["plane"],
  "accommodations": ["hotel"],
  "destinations": ["Europe", "Asia"],
  "interests": ["culture", "food"],
  "startDate": Timestamp,
  "endDate": Timestamp,
  "completed": true,
  "timestamp": Timestamp,
  "userName": "Kevin"
}
```

## üìù How to Use the App

1. **Join a Group**: User joins or is added to a group.
2. **Take the Survey**: Users input preferences (budget, dates, interests).
3. **Trigger AI Search**:

   * Go to the group page and tap the FAB.
   * If all users completed the survey, AI will suggest trips.
   * If not, a prompt will ask them to take the survey first.
4. **View Recommendations**: Three destination cards are shown with descriptions, attractions, and average prices.
5. **See Flight Deals**: Tap a destination to view real-time flight deals within the group‚Äôs consensus date range.
